# Street Art Bot

A ROS (Robot Operating System) based street art robot that can map an unknown environment while locating itself within it. The user inputs an image, and the robot finds an appropriate place within the environment to paint the image on. The selection of ROS was justified as it provides the tools, libraries and capabilities needed to develop robotics applications whilst consuming resources minimally. The algorithms used to approach the task include A* and Monte Carlo Localisation algorithms.
